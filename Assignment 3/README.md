# CS161-Assignment3
This is my week 3 assignment for CS161.


Project 3.a

Write a program that asks the user how many integers they would like to enter.  You can assume they will enter an integer >= 1.
The program will then prompt the user to enter that many integers.  After all the numbers have been entered, the program
should display the largest and smallest of those numbers (no, you cannot use arrays, or any other material we haven't covered).


Project 3.b

Write a program that prints "Please enter your filename.", reads in the name of the file, and then tries to open it.
If the input file is there and can be opened, the program should read the list of integers in the file, which will
have one integer per line


Project 3.c

Write a program that prompts the user for an integer that the player (maybe the user, maybe someone else) will try to guess.
If the player's guess is higher than the target number, the program should display "too high."
If the user's guess is lower than the target number, the program should display "too low"
The program should use a loop that repeats until the user correctly guesses the number.
Then the program should print how many guesses it took.
